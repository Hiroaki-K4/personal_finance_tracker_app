# personal_finance_tracker_app
This project involves creating an interactive, text-based Personal Finance Tracker
App that helps users manage and analyze their spending habits. Users can import
a CSV file containing transaction data, perform operations like viewing, adding,
editing, and deleting transactions, and analyze spending patterns. The app also
includes data visualization capabilities, displaying monthly spending trends and
top spending categories. The project emphasizes Python programming, pandas
for data handling, and matplotlib for visualization, along with GitHub for
collaboration and version control.
